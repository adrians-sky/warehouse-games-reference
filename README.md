# About

Over the past year I've become a big Jomboy Media fan. I especially enjoy 
the warehouse games, and I thought about creating a dataset to track 
players stats. 

This would ~~eventually~~ include all of the main Franchise Leagues 
(Blitzball Battle, Floorball, Ball in Play), as well as others like 
Captain's League, the Challenger Series, the 1 Inning League and 
1 Inning League Roulette (my personal favourite!)

None of the content is mine. This is a "fun" project.
